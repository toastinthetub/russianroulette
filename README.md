# russianroulette
Incredibly simple text-based russian roulette game written in Rust. 

I've been trying to learn this language, and this borrows a lot of concepts that I learned from the guessing game in the Rust book. This is incredibly simple, and a testament to how 
bad I am at programming. But it works. So, yeah. "Functional" is a new high when it comes to me and Rust <3
