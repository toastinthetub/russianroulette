|YOU GRASP THE REVOLVER ON THE TABLE BEFORE YOU, WITH CONFIDENT|
|AND DISGUSTING RESOLVE. A TERRIBLE SMILE REMAINS ON YOUR SMUG |
|FACE. YOU LOOK ME IN MY EYES AS YOU RAISE THE STEEL BARREL TO |
|YOUR SKULL. YOU NEITHER BLINK NOR FLINCH AS YOU SQUEEZE THE   |
|TRIGGER.                                                      |
